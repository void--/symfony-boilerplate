symfony-boilerplate
===================

Sensible defaults for a symfony web project including asset management with gulp.

To get started run `composer install` and `npm install`, you can then start the built in php webserver using `./console server:run`. To compile frontend assets and launch browserSync run `gulp` from the docroot.
